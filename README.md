PS note this is the first time ever I have used encryption

1. Since Caplinked works on data security, I did some research on encryption and thought of implementing two encrytion method namely AES and tripleDEs for this challenge 
2. The two classes derives namely Aesencryption and Desencryption are derived from the base class Encrypt , based on which object the calls the method 
encryptdecrypt, different types of encrytpion takes place. This shows inheritance , polymorphism and abstraction 

3. Most difficult challenge that I faced was getting all the libraries to work together, But was able to do in the end
